I'm Daniel, born and raised in Almada, Portugal. I'm a Fullstack Web Developer and I really enjoy learning new languages and frameworks, and challenge myself to develop more skills for myself. I also like dig into Networking stuff like Cisco Networking (Routing and Switching) and Outsystems Platforms. Feel free to check out my portfolio and contact me if you want!
